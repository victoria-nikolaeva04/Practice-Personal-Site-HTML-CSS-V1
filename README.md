# Practice-Personal-Site-HTML-CSS-V1

After HTML, my journey into web development naturally led me to explore CSS as a means of enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the site. In transitioning from pure HTML to incorporating CSS, the core structure of the HTML files remained largely intact, with only minor adjustments made. As I delved deeper into CSS, I found myself layering customization onto the existing foundation laid by HTML. This process allowed the infusion of vibrant colors, diverse typefaces, and intricate details that added the site with a bit more personality. However, the trade-off became apparent as I encountered challenges in altering the placement of elements within the site. Modifying such aspects often necessitated extensive reworking of the HTML code and I wanted to see how far can CSS can go with a pre-existing platform.
